A toy manufacturing organization manufactures two types of toys A and B. What should be the manufacturing quantity for each of the toys to maximize the profits?



Problem: 
A toy manufacturing organization manufactures two types of toys A and B. Both the toys are sold at Rs.25 and Rs.20 respectively. There are 2000 resource units available every day from which the toy A requires 20 units while toy B requires 12 units. Both of these toys require a production time of 5 minutes. Total working hours are 9 hours a day. What should be the manufacturing quantity for each of the pipes to maximize the profits?

Here:
The objective function is:
Max.Z=25x+20y
where x are the units of pipe A
y are the units of pipe B
Constraints:
20x+12y<=2000
5x+5y<=540
Letâ€™s see the code part now:
